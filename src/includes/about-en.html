          Once, at the opening of the French store <span class="about__text--loccitane">Lâ€™Occitane</span>, we were
          treated to Macarons. Never before have I tasted such a delicious delicate dessert. After that, I started
          looking and looking for at least something like that. But unfortunately it was difficult for me to find where
          one could buy such cakes. Only in good expensive coffee shops can you find delicious macarons, and even then,
          if they are fresh and properly stored. After all, their shelf life is 3-4 days.
          That's why I decided to learn how to cook them myself!

          After spending a year on it, changing the oven from gas to electric, looking at many sites, spending a lot of
          products: I found a stable recipe for cooking.

          just starting this way!
